# Python Programming Exercises

This repository contains a series of Python programming exercises designed to improve both basic and advanced programming skills. The exercises cover various topics, including string manipulation, function usage, and handling positive and negative numbers.

## Repository Content

1. **say_hello.py**
    - **Description:** This script contains a function `say_hello` that adds the string "Hello, " at the beginning and "!" at the end of any given input. The function correctly handles cases where the input is empty or contains only whitespace, returning "Hello, World!" in such cases. Additionally, the function can handle inputs that are not strings, converting them to strings before adding the greeting.
    - **Usage Examples:**

2. **Positive_and_Negative_numbers.py**
    - **Description:** This script generates and handles positive and negative numbers. It uses the `random` library to generate random numbers and organizes them into lists of positive and negative numbers. It includes functions to iterate over these numbers and print them.
    - **Main Functions:**
        - `loop_numbers()`: Populates the `list_positive_numbers` and `list_negative_numbers` lists with positive and negative numbers, respectively.
        - `printumbers()`: Prints the even positive and negative numbers from the lists.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `random` library (included in Python's standard library)
